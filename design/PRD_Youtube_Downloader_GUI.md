# YouTube Downloader GUI - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The YouTube Downloader GUI is a desktop application that provides a user-friendly graphical interface for downloading YouTube videos using the yt-dlp command-line tool. The application aims to simplify the process of downloading YouTube content by providing an intuitive interface with task management capabilities.

## Problem Statement
While yt-dlp is a powerful command-line tool for downloading YouTube videos, it requires technical knowledge and command-line experience. Many users prefer graphical interfaces but still want the powerful features of yt-dlp. This application bridges that gap by providing a macOS-styled GUI for yt-dlp, making it accessible to more users while maintaining all its functionality.

## User Personas
- **Casual Users**: People who occasionally want to download YouTube videos for offline viewing
- **Content Creators**: Users who need to download videos for reference or educational purposes
- **Media Professionals**: Users who need to archive or collect YouTube content regularly
- **Educators**: Teachers who want to download educational content for classroom use

## Requirements

- Support for downloading videos from YouTube with all yt-dlp's capabilities
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- macOS-styled interface across all platforms

#### Homepage
- Clean, organized interface with a toolbar and task list
- Task list displaying all download tasks with their details and status

#### Toolbar
1. **New Task Button**
   - Opens a popup dialog to create a new download task

   - Default download path configuration
   - Default cookie source selection (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
   - Corresponds to the yt-dlp `--cookies-from-browser` parameter

#### Task List
- Display details for each download task:
  - Video title (fetched from YouTube)
  - URL
  - Progress bar showing download progress
  - Download speed (captured from yt-dlp terminal output)
  - File size
- Action buttons for each task:
  - Start/Pause download
  - Delete task
  - Open file location
- Persistent task list that matches with downloaded files on disk

#### Extra Functions
- Initial system check to verify yt-dlp and ffmpeg installations
- Notification system to inform users of missing dependencies
- Real-time fetching and updating of video titles from YouTube URLs
- Automatic inclusion of `--cookies-from-browser` parameter to bypass YouTube bot detection
- Task queue management for multiple downloads

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Minimal resource usage when idle, efficient handling of multiple download tasks
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface consistent with macOS design principles
- **Reliability**: Stable operation with proper error handling
- **Security**: Safe handling of browser cookies and user data
- **Compatibility**: 
  - macOS (10.15+)
  - Windows (10+)
  - Linux (major distributions)

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Desktop Framework**: Electron
- **Design System**: macOS-styled UI components
- **Dependencies**: yt-dlp, ffmpeg (external)

## User Interface

### Main Window

## Implementation Considerations
- Shell command execution to interface with yt-dlp
- Output parsing to capture download progress and speed
- Inter-process communication between Electron main and renderer processes
- Cross-platform file path handling

## Success Metrics
- User adoption rate
- Download completion success rate
- Average time to complete first download (onboarding metric)
- Error rate and error recovery success

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Basic application shell with React and Electron
