## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Electron + React
- **UI Library**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Electron Architecture

The application follows the standard Electron architecture with two main processes:

- **Main Process**: Handles system-level operations, IPC communication, and window management
- **Renderer Process**: Runs the React application and handles UI interactions

### 2. Component Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with the following hierarchy:

```
App
├── TitleBar
├── Toolbar
├── DownloadList
│   └── DownloadItem
├── NewTaskModal
└── Settings
```

### 3. State Management

- Local component state managed through React Hooks
- Global state handled through Electron's IPC system
- Persistent storage using electron-store

### 4. IPC Communication

The application uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for:

- Download management
- Settings persistence
- File system operations
- System notifications

### 5. Security Considerations

- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- Sandboxed renderer process
- Secure IPC communication
- Input validation and sanitization

## Design Patterns

1. **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components with clear responsibilities
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: IPC-based communication between processes
3. **Observer Pattern**: Progress updates and status notifications
4. **Factory Pattern**: Download task creation and management

## Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
2. **Efficient Updates**: Optimized re-renders using React Hooks
3. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of downloads and system resources
4. **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large downloads

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**: Support for multiple concurrent downloads
2. **Extensibility**: Plugin system for additional features
3. **Offline Support**: Queue management and resume capability
4. **Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior across different operating systems
